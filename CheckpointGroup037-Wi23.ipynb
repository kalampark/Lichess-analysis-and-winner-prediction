    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of the reserach is to take advatnage of Lichess's online recorded matches to determine the factors that most strongly influences winning and to build a model that is able to predict the winner based on the factors found. The data used in this project represents various quantitative and qualitative measures of the competitors (~20,000 matches), in which we will use Logistic Regression as a baseline model using the significant factors, and create a filtered dataset for further analysis and model selection. We currently plan to use the SVM and Random Forests algorithms to select the model whilst cross-validating the model using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. This research aims to contribute to the understanding of complex competition, as well as assist in developing game strategies that closely links to success."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Chess is one of the world's most popular strategy games to date, and its ever-growing popularity has been heavily expedited due to the growing number of online platforms (Chess.com, Lichess) and users. With numerous events, streams, tutors, and creators online, chess can now be played and learned virtually anytime, anywhere. With the insurmountable amount of variations, openings, and data that comes with chess, the average player likely just scracthes the surface in understanding the deep complexity the game consists of. The emergence of AI and machine learning have offered a solution to this common dilemma, by providing a way to compute the mass amounts of available data and train the computer to do the thinking for them. That being said, AI and chess bots are amongst the most well known examples, popular for its near perfect chess performance, as well as a way of cheating.<a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote) There has also been a lot of research on chess analysis and playing, such as Stockfish project, an opensource chess analysis algorithm which can provide players with an after game review with one of the most powerful chessbots.<a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#lorenznote) Evidently such knowledge can be highly beneficial in strategizing moves, openings, and sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, our proposed work aims to provide helpful information by analyzing 20,000 Lichess matches and highlighting the variables that most heavily influences a user to win the match. Upon gathering these factors, we plan to restructure and split the dataset in order to train a model into predicting a winner based on some user inputs. This in hopes will help users strategize between openings, first moves, and help determine if white pieces really have an inherent advantage in novice to professional level matches. <a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#lorenznote)"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Each side starting with 16 pieces, 6 different roles, and 64 squares there are nearly 10^120 different chess game variations, also known as Shannon's Number, which is more than there are atoms in the observable universe. <a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#lorenznote) We will be looking at the different features contained within our data to see the highest correlated with a win for white(1), a win for black(0), or a draw (2). Logistic Regression will serve as our baseline classifier because of its simplicity and replicability. We will compare its performance to more complex algorithms such as Random Forests and Support Vector Machinees quantified using confusion matricies and a ROC curve. After evaluation we select the model that performs best on the test and validation sets and its ability to generalize, to provide a comprehensive analysis of these games and potential winning strategies. \n"

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict the winner of the chess game, we will compare three different classification models and select the best one based on their respective performances, as measured by the evaluation metrics accuracy and f1 score. The three models we will use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a method that aims to fit a linear decision boundary that separates classes based on their input features. Since there are three outcomes in our dataset, white win (1), black win (0), and draw (2), we will use use a one vs rest classifier in our logistic regression model to classify the three outcomes. In order to implement this model, we will split our dataset into training, validation, and test sets, where we will first train the model, tune the hyperparameters using the validation set, evaluate it based on accuracy and f1 score, and finally predict classifications using the test set. We will use gradient descent to find the best hyperparameters that minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests is a method that combines multiple decision trees that are each trained on a random subset of the training data and a random subset of the input features. We are using random forests because this method has many advantages over simple decision trees. For instance, random forests reduce overfitting by averaging the predictions of many decision trees. More importantly, however, random forests provide a measure of the importance of each feature by evaluating how much the performance of the model changes when different features are removed. This will help us determine which feature (player ratings, opening moves, piece color, etc.) are most important in predicting a winner. We will follow a similar method as with Logistic Regression to evaluate our Random Forests model. That is, we will split the data into training and test sets, train the model on the training set, tune the hyperparameters on the training set using k-fold cross-validation, evaluate the model based on accuaracy and f1 score, and finally predict classifications using the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is a method that aims to find a hyperplane that separates classes while creating the largest margin between the classes, which is determined by support vectors within the classes. This is achieved by minimizing a loss function that accounts for both misclassification errors and points that are within the margin surrounding the decision boundary hyperplane. We will most likely use linear SVM since this handles large datasets well, and we do not anticipate any curvature to or nonlinear patters in the data. As with the Logistic Regression and Random Forests models, we will begin by splitting our data set into training and test sets. Then we will train the model on the traning set using a one vs one classifier. Next we will tune the hyperparameters on the training set using k-fold cross-validation and evaluate the model based on accuracy and f1 score, and finally we will predict classifications using the test set."

    "Additionally, we will calculate the f1 score to compare our models. Since there are 3 outcomes in our classification problem, we must use a weighted average f1 score. That means precision, recall, and f1 score will be calculated 3 times each. Each class (white win, black win, and draw) will serve as the positive class for one round of calculations, with the remaining two classes serving as the negative class. For example, for one calculation of precision, recall and f1 score, white win will be the positive class, and black win or draw will be the negative class. Precision, recall, and f1 score will be calculated by the following formulae:\n",
    "\n",
    "    TP = number of instances correctly classified as positive class (e.g. white win predicted as white win)\n",
    "    FP = number of instances incorrectly classified as positive class (e.g. black win or draw predicted as white win)\n",
    "    FN = number of instances incorrectly classified as negative class (e.g. white win predicted as black win or draw)\n",
    "    TN = number of instances correctly classified as negative class (e.g. black win or draw predicted as black win or draw)\n",
    "    precision = TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "    recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n",
    "    f1 score = (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall)\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the weighted average f1 score, we will use the following formulae:\n",
    "\n",
    "    N_white_win = number of instances in dataset of white win\n",
    "    N_black_win = number of instances in dataset of black win\n",
    "    N_draw = number of instances in dataset of draw\n",
    "    N_total = number of total instances in dataset\n",
    "    f1 weighted average = ((F1 score white win * N_white_win) + (F1 score black win * N_black_win) + (F1 score draw * N_draw)) / N_total\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to use the weighted average f1 score to account for the imbalanced class sizes we have, since there are significantly fewer instances of draws than of white wins or black wins. The weighted average f1 score gives more weight to classes that have more instances, so this works well in our situation."
